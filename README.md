# frontend-nanodegree-neighbourhood-map

===============================

## Description

This is my project for the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree: Neighbourhood Map.

A live version of the application can be viewed at [github.io](https://leogovan.github.io/neighbourhood-map-project/).

The application utilises knockout.js and:

1. Calls Google Maps asynchronously to display a map
2. Calls FourSqaure asynchronously to collect 20 cafes near to Forest Hill, London, UK
3. Displays the cafes in a list on the side of the page
4. Populates the map with markers for the cafes, generated using location data grabbed from the foursquare response
5. If the user clicks on a map marker, an infowindow will pop open displaying the name of the cafe and the marker will begin to bounce
6. If a list item is clicked, the same behaviour described in point 5 occurs
7. The user can filter the list by simply typing into the available input field. This will visibly remove items from the list while it tries to match to the string entered
8. In tandem with the filter, the corresponding markers will also be filtered off the map
9. Clearing the input field will reset the filter

The UI is responsive.
